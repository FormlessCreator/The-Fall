Cities glowed with the brilliance of neon, humming with the energy of automated systems, artificial intelligence, and biotechnological advancements. But beneath this polished surface lay shadows—an overreliance on technology, unchecked greed, and the thirst for scientific domination.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Victor Chang's neural implant experiment was meant to be humanity's next step in evolution. Instead, it became its undoing. Designed to enhance cognitive function, the neural implants unexpectedly unleashed a horrifying side effect. A mutation in the implant's bio-connective gel caused uncontrollable aggression and reanimated dead tissue. The first infected appeared within hours—a perfect storm of biological and neurological chaos, spreading like wildfire.</p>

                <h2>The Ruins of Civilization</h2>
                <h3>Urban Desolation</h3>
                <p>Skyscrapers, once symbols of progress, now stand as tombstones. Overgrown with vines and crawling with undead, they echo with the faint sounds of automated announcements and the occasional screech of scavenging animals. Some cities remain shrouded in chemical mists from failed containment efforts, their air toxic but eerily luminescent at night.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h3>The Old Town</h3>
                <p>Once a cultural hub, it now serves as a battleground. Barricades of cars and debris crisscross the streets. Burned-out buildings tell stories of desperate last stands. In the center stands "Hope Plaza," its towering sculpture defaced, now serving as a grim warning of what was lost.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h3>Ruins of John’s Village</h3>
                <p>Surrounded by a dark forest, the village is a haunting contrast to the urban decay. It whispers tales of simpler times, now overshadowed by tragic mass graves and abandoned homes.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h3>Research Facilities</h3>
                <p>Cold, sterile halls remain intact, shielded by reinforced walls. The labs are still buzzing, not with life, but with the mechanical hum of undisturbed machines processing endless loops of forgotten commands. Here, Jane searches for a cure while battling her inner demons.</p>

                <h2>Survivor Settlements</h2>
                <h3>The Bastion</h3>
                <p>A fortified desert outpost built from scrap metal and ingenuity, serving as a beacon of hope. Armed with wind turbines and solar panels, it’s self-sufficient, but only as long as they can keep the undead—and each other—at bay.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h3>Sanctuaries Turned Nightmares</h3>
                <p>Many shelters became death traps when infected infiltrated them. These locations now house hordes of dormant undead, making them perilous but treasure-laden destinations for scavengers.</p>
