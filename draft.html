            <h2>Deliverable Type</h2>
            <p>For this project, I have chosen to create an unessay interactive website that showcases how AI enhances creativity and productivity in game design. This includes sections for AI-generated art, music, 3D models, and narratives.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="project-description">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The project will specifically feature an 'AI Creativity and Productivity in Game Design' gallery, where users can explore different AI-generated content. This interactive platform will highlight the intersection of technology and art in game development.</p>

        <section id="draft-progress">
            <h2>Draft Progress</h2>
            <p>So far, I have completed the initial HTML structure and navigation for the website. I am currently working on integrating the AI-generated content and ensuring the layout is user-friendly. Below is a brief outline of the sections I've created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Header with navigation links.</li>
                <li>Main content sections for art, music, 3D models, and text stories.</li>
                <li>Footer with copyright information.</li>
                <li>Home page.</li>

                    <p>
                        The Biome Generation Tool (BGT) is a Unity3D plugin using Evolutionary Algorithms to help create game biomes. In a study with 28 developers, those using the standard BGT reported higher satisfaction, productivity, and appreciation for AI support than a control group. Results indicate that BGT effectively aids biome design, enhancing quality and reducing workload, with plans for further validation.</p>

                    <p>New technologies, including AI, have greatly changed the labor market and how we work together. Gamification has become a useful approach to improve productivity and engagement, especially in human resources. AI enhances gamification by personalizing experiences and tracking progress. This approach is particularly effective for developing and assessing soft skills, which are important for the success of individuals and teams.</p>

                    <p>
                        Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in many fields, leading countries to create national policies to support its growth. This competition for AI is driving industrial development. Recent research has made significant progress in AI. This article looks at how AI connects with other emerging technologies in the context of technology entrepreneurship, focusing on its role from idea generation to taking advantage of business opportunities. It also suggests areas for future research.</p>

                    <p>
                        The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) brings new opportunities and challenges for creativity. This manifesto explores how humans and machines can collaborate on creative tasks and suggests "fundamental laws of generative AI" for responsible use. It presents four scenarios—"Co-Cre-AI-tion," "Organic," "Plagiarism 3.0," and "Shut down"—that show different future possibilities. The manifesto highlights themes like accessibility and ethics, aiming to prevent harmful content and ensure AI complements rather than competes with humans. The goal is a future where AI and humans work together to enhance creativity while respecting ethical values.</p>

                    <p>New AI music generators use different technologies to help casual users create music easily and assist experienced musicians. While these tools could change music creation for the better, they also raise concerns: AI-generated music can boost creativity but may threaten the jobs of the musicians who create it.</p>

                    <p>The video game industry is struggling, with over 10,000 layoffs in 2023 and another 11,000 this year. Companies like Microsoft have closed studios, such as Tango Gameworks and Alpha Dog Games. At the same time, the rise of generative AI from companies like OpenAI is impacting many industries, including gaming, and threatening jobs as AI is increasingly used for tasks traditionally done by humans.</p>
